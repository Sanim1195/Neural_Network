# 5
# The matrix product  is an operation in which we have 2 matrices, and we are performing dot products of all combinations of rows from the first matrix and the columns of the 2nd matrix,resulting in a matrix of those atomic dot products

# IMP: To perform a matrix product, the size of the second dimension of the left (5,4) matrix must match the size of the first dimension of the right matrix (4,3).

# Imp: Transposition simply modifies a matrix in a way that its rows become columns and columns become rows.
