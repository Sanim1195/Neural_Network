# print(f"The shape of another_list_of_lists is: {np.shape(another_list_of_lists)}")      ðŸ‘ˆ Will throw an error because the array has inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions
# The above list of lists cannot be an array because it is not homologous
# A list of lists is homologous if each list along a dimension is identically long,
# and this must be true for each dimension



# What is a Tensor??
# A tensor object is an object that can be represented as an array
# we can (and will) treat tensors as arrays in the context of deep learning



# What is a vector?
#  A vector is simply described as a 1D ARRAY or a list in Python
# Of course, lists and NumPy arrays do not have
# the same properties as a vector, but, just as we can write a matrix as a list of lists in Python, we
# can also write a vector as a list or an array!
