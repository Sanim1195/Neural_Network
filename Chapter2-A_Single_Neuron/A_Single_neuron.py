#           For a single Neuron

#  when you initialize parameters in neural networks, our network will have weights initialized randomly, and biases set as zero to start
# The input will be either atual training data or the otputs of the previous layer

# This neuron sums each input multiplied by that inputâ€™s weight, then adds the bias
